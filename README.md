# Recipe App
The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It allows the user to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what user is missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow to make them public so anyone can access them.
